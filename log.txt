  Embedding method can achieve at most 3.5 when card_range(2, 5) as well as card_range(2, 30)

  Actions are related to the input. Should not use a fixed embedding. The embedding should be related to the input

  I dont think this is possible.
  RNN and FNN fails to handle index input.

  boundary handle:
    1. filter when searching
    2. don't change the state, give a negative reward
